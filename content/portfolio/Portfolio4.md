📱💰🛍️ A Coupon App is a mobile application that allows users to search, save, and redeem coupons and discounts offered by participating retailers. 🏪🛒 Users can browse through a variety of coupons, offers, and deals from various stores and brands, filtered by location or specific categories. The app may also feature user reviews and ratings to help users make informed decisions. 💻📈 Once the user has selected the coupon they wish to use, they can present it in-store or apply it during online checkout, and save money in the process. The app may also provide notifications when new deals are available and expiration dates of existing coupons. 💸💳
